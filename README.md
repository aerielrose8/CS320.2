How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Language choice is a big factor when looking at program and what needs to be done and how secure it needs to be. As well as using the knowledge I have gained on securing coed
throughout my degree. 
I do this through trial and error testing of the code using a black box and white box techniques in testing the functionality of each program built.


How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Inturpreting userneeds is affected by many things, first its who is the user, without that information you wont make it to far then to inturperat what they are tryingin todo,
and how they plan to it and how I plan to help them. I also like to inturperet what influences them to use or need the product and take that in how I make it user friendly

How do I approach designing software?
when it comes to designing software I do my best to approach it with a highlevel of systems thinking, a good layout and great knowledge on the exact functions the user and the client are looking for
while also thinking in the mideset of reusability and making sure its easy to test.
